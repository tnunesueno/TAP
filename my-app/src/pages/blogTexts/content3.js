    Extracurricular activities are an important boost to college applications. They show engagement in activities outside of school. They show that you are involved in the community. They show what your interests are, though you may not have spelled these interests out in the Common App essay. Involvement in high school implies involvement in college, and colleges want people who can take advantage of their resources, people who will be actively involved in the community. Thus, the Activities section of the Common App is crucial. But how do you pick activities to curate your list? 
	
    First of all, remember that the Activities section encompasses more than just your extracurriculars. It can be school sponsored activities, yes, like clubs or sports teams, but it can also be things like community service or a job. Many things fit the criteria for your Activities list. 
    
    It is important to start your extracurricular activities early in your high school career. Colleges are interested in commitment as well as interest, and joining earlier can give you a better chance of getting a leadership position in a club, which looks great on applications. It isn’t just about being interested in a lot of things, it’s about showing commitment and growth in your chosen interests. 
    
    These activities should be chosen based on what you are interested in, who you are as  a person. Authenticity is important. For example, if you are interested in theater, you can join the drama society or a community theater production. If you are interested in activism, you can join activist groups inside or outside of school. If you are interested in soccer, you can join your school's team and get a job teaching at a summer camp. These are just ideas of how to turn your interests into extracurriculars.
    
    There are many articles about which extracurriculars are “better” for college applications, but at the end of the day, it should be based on what you are interested in. There’s no point getting involved in something because you think it will look good on a college application if you don’t enjoy it. Follow your passions. Colleges want to know what you are interested in, even if it isn’t the thing that people say will get you in. 
    
    When listing extracurriculars on your college application, order is important. What extracurriculars are the most unique, or interesting. Which ones show your engagement? Remember that the extracurriculars are telling a subtle story about you, but the order decides in which order that story is told. Where are your priorities? 
    
    Extracurricular activities are a crucial part of the Common App. In your college applications, neither your grades nor your test scores stand alone, and alone they may not be enough to get you into your chosen university. The Common App is a portrait of you as a person, and the extracurriculars indicate your interests outside of school.
